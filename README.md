# Computer-Graphics-Final-Project

- Trimap given (100-50-0) percentage chance of being intestine
- stage 1: get as close to the trimap as possible
  - Otsu's Thresholding
- stage 2: work on a 3D gaussian matting algorithm to segment what we know to be intestine out (discuss performance with divya)
- stage 3: work on 3D reconstrction of intestine from the matte. Done together with matting algorithm
